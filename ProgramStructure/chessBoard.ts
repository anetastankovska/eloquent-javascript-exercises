/*
Chessboard
 Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline
 characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space
 or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
 Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
  # # # #
 # # # #
  # # # #
 # # # #
  # # # #
 # # # #
  # # # #
 # # # #
 When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size
 = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid
 of the given width and height.
